    Hi there! In this lesson we'll create some charts with count data.
    We will use some historical data from Spanish, regarding verbs of mocking ('burlar' and 'mofar').
    I have loaded the data for you (its called `mock_verbs`). Each row is an example of either of these
    verbs in historical corporal, and it is anotated for the presence or absence of both a reflexive pronoun
    and a complement with the preposition `de`, as well as for which verb appeared in the example and the
    year of the example.

  Output: >
    As you can see, I have also loaded the libraries tidyverse and wesanderson (with colour palettes) for 
    you. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Print `mock_verbs` to see how it looks like.
  CorrectAnswer: mock_verbs
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mock_verbs')
  Hint: Just run its name!

- Class: figure
  Output: >
    We will plot what you should be seeing in your viewer now. That is, the number of examples with and
    without a de-complement by verb in a barplot.

    For that, we'll first have to calculate those occurrances, with `count`. Because we want to know
    how many examples there are grouping by to variables (Verb and De_complement), it should have those
    two arguments. Using a pipe, let's count them. Put the arguments in the order I mentioned them!
  CorrectAnswer: mock_verbs %>% count(Verb, De_complement)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mock_verbs %>% count(Verb, De_complement)')
  Hint: Remember to use a pipe and separate both arguments of `count` by commas.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Now we generated a table with all the information that we need, so we can start our plot. Let's do it in
    this same pipe. Add `ggplot` with a pipe. Inside, add the argument `aes()`, which is a function.
    Its arguments are the variables that we want to plot. In the x-axis we want to have presence/absence of
    De_complement, so we should write `x = De_complement`. In the y-axis we want to have the number of 
    occurrances, which is stored in column n. This should be the second argument.
  CorrectAnswer: mock_verbs %>% count(Verb, De_complement) %>% ggplot(aes(x = De_complement, y = n))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mock_verbs %>% count(Verb, De_complement) %>% ggplot(aes(x = De_complement, y = n))')
  Hint: The second argument of aes() should be `y = n`.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    An empty plot just appeared in your viewer. But why is it empty? Because we didn't add a layer with
    the geometry! So ggplot does not know that we want to have a barplot. Add geom_col() to your code, 
    and remember that you don't need to use a pipe, but a plus sign!
  CorrectAnswer: mock_verbs %>% count(Verb, De_complement) %>% ggplot(aes(x = De_complement, y = n)) + geom_col()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mock_verbs %>% count(Verb, De_complement) %>% ggplot(aes(x = De_complement, y = n)) + geom_col()')
  Hint: geom_col() should be empty and have the parentheses.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    We're getting closer! In order to create two subplots, one with data from each verb, we need to use one 
    of my favourite functions from ggplot2: `facet_wrap`. Add it after a plus sign to your code.
    As its argument, write `~Verb` (with no quotation marks). This function uses a peculiar syntax, 
    as you see, with the tilde. Try it out.
  CorrectAnswer: >
    mock_verbs %>% count(Verb, De_complement) %>% ggplot(aes(x = De_complement, y = n)) + geom_col() + facet_wrap(~Verb)
  AnswerTests:  >
    omnitest(correctExpr='mock_verbs %>% count(Verb, De_complement) %>% ggplot(aes(x = De_complement, y = n)) + geom_col() + facet_wrap(~Verb)')
  Hint: You should add facet_wrap(~Verb) after a plus sign at the end of your code.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    As you can see, the scale of both subplots is the same one. Because `mofar` has much fewer examples than 
    `burlar`, our visualization does not look so great. But we can add the argument `scales = "free"` to
    facet_wrap to fix this. Do it now.
  CorrectAnswer:  >
    mock_verbs %>% count(Verb, De_complement) %>% ggplot(aes(x = De_complement, y = n)) + geom_col() + facet_wrap(~Verb, scales = "free")
  AnswerTests:  >
    omnitest(correctExpr='mock_verbs %>% count(Verb, De_complement) %>% ggplot(aes(x = De_complement, y = n)) + geom_col() + facet_wrap(~Verb, scales = "free")')
  Hint: The content of facet_wrap should be `~Verb, scales = "free"`.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Now we can add some labels to our plot with the function labs(). Set the argument `title` to 
    "Presence of de-complements by verb", `x` to "Presence of de-complement" and `y` to "Occurrences".
  CorrectAnswer:  >
    mock_verbs %>% count(Verb, De_complement) %>% ggplot(aes(x = De_complement, y = n)) + geom_col() + facet_wrap(~Verb, scales = "free") + labs(title = "Presence of de-complements by verb", x = "Presence of de-complement", y = "Occurrences")
  AnswerTests:  >
    omnitest(correctExpr='mock_verbs %>% count(Verb, De_complement) %>% ggplot(aes(x = De_complement, y = n)) + geom_col() + facet_wrap(~Verb, scales = "free") + labs(title = "Presence of de-complements by verb", x = "Presence of de-complement", y = "Occurrences")')
  Hint: >
    All the functions you add now should follow a plus sign, not a pipe. And you need the quotations 
    for the titles!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    And we can also change the general appearance of the plot, by adding theme_light() to our code, for 
    instance. Try it out.
  CorrectAnswer:  >
    mock_verbs %>% count(Verb, De_complement) %>% ggplot(aes(x = De_complement, y = n)) + geom_col() + facet_wrap(~Verb, scales = "free") + labs(title = "Presence of de-complements by verb", x = "Presence of de-complement", y = "Occurrences") + theme_light()
  AnswerTests:  >
    omnitest(correctExpr='mock_verbs %>% count(Verb, De_complement) %>% ggplot(aes(x = De_complement, y = n)) + geom_col() + facet_wrap(~Verb, scales = "free") + labs(title = "Presence of de-complements by verb", x = "Presence of de-complement", y = "Occurrences") + theme_light()')
  Hint: >
    All the functions you add now should follow a plus sign, not a pipe! This one is empty.

- Class: text
  Output: You already know how to customize other elements of the plot, so we'll leave this one here.

- Class: figure
  Output: >
    Let's add a bit more of complexity to our visualizations. We will plot what you should be seeing in 
    your viewer now. That is, the number of examples with and without a de-complement, but also with
    and without a reflexive pronoun, by verb in a barplot.

  Output: >
    Again, we'll need to start by creating the table with the data we want to have. That is, we need to 
    calculate the number of occurrances in each subgroup. The code we need is very similar to the one we 
    just had, but we need to add an extra argument to count(), namely, `Reflexive_pronoun`. Using a pipe, 
    calculate the occurrances using `count()`. Put the arguments in the following order: 
    Verb, De_complement, Reflexive_pronoun.
  CorrectAnswer: mock_verbs %>% count(Verb, De_complement, Reflexive_pronoun)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mock_verbs %>% count(Verb, De_complement, Reflexive_pronoun)')
  Hint: Remember to use a pipe and separate all arguments of `count` by commas. Check your code above, it's quite similar!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    So the next step is, again, to add the function ggplot() to our pipe. It should look very similar to 
    what we haf above, but with a new argument, because we want to also have colour as a variable.
    This argument is called `fill` and it is determined by the column `Reflexive_pronoun`. Add ggplot()
    to your code by aapating what you had above.
  CorrectAnswer: mock_verbs %>% count(Verb, De_complement, Reflexive_pronoun) %>% ggplot(aes(x = De_complement, y = n, fill = Reflexive_pronoun))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mock_verbs %>% count(Verb, De_complement, Reflexive_pronoun) %>% ggplot(aes(x = De_complement, y = n, fill = Reflexive_pronoun))')
  Hint: Please add `fill = Reflexive_pronoun` as the third argument.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Again our plot is empty… But you know why now! Add geom_col() to your code. And, since you're at it, 
    add facet_wrap(~Verb, scales = "free") too.
  CorrectAnswer:  >
    mock_verbs %>% count(Verb, De_complement, Reflexive_pronoun) %>% ggplot(aes(x = De_complement, y = n, fill = Reflexive_pronoun)) + geom_col() + facet_wrap(~Verb, scales = "free")
  AnswerTests:  >
    omnitest(correctExpr='mock_verbs %>% count(Verb, De_complement, Reflexive_pronoun) %>% ggplot(aes(x = De_complement, y = n, fill = Reflexive_pronoun)) + geom_col() + facet_wrap(~Verb, scales = "free")')
  Hint: Remember that you should add these functions after a plus sign now.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Just to do something fancy, let's use one of the wesanderon palettes. Because we want to modify the
    colours of a fill variable, we need the function `scale_fill_manual()`. We'll pick the fifth and second
    colour of the palette called "Darjeeling" and we need to write that in the argument called `values`. 
    The syntax we need is a bit difficult, so I'll tell you what to type. Add
    `scale_fill_manual(values = wes_palette("Darjeeling1")[c(5, 2)])` after a plus sign.
  CorrectAnswer:  >
    mock_verbs %>% count(Verb, De_complement, Reflexive_pronoun) %>% ggplot(aes(x = De_complement, y = n, fill = Reflexive_pronoun)) + geom_col() + facet_wrap(~Verb, scales = "free") + scale_fill_manual(values = wes_palette("Darjeeling1")[c(5, 2)])
  AnswerTests:  >
    omnitest(correctExpr='mock_verbs %>% count(Verb, De_complement, Reflexive_pronoun) %>% ggplot(aes(x = De_complement, y = n, fill = Reflexive_pronoun)) + geom_col() + facet_wrap(~Verb, scales = "free") + scale_fill_manual(values = wes_palette("Darjeeling1")[c(5, 2)])')
  Hint: Add what I gave you to your code after a plus sign.

    To understand the syntax we used (especially regarding the use of brackets), I recommend you do 
    the first swirl lessons of the R programming course when you get some time.

- Class: text
  Output: >
    This plot has a lot of information, but is based on absolute number of examples. Using a relative
    measure, such as a percentage, will provide us a nicer comparison. It is good to look at both, to see
    on how many examples are statistics are based on - you can already see that we don't have that many 
    examples of `mofar`.

- Class: figure
  Output: >
    The plot we want to create now looks like the one that just appeared in your viewer. As you can see, it
    is very similar to the one that we did, so we will be able to recycle some of our code again.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Again, we need to create the table with the data we want to have first. Here we want to start with the 
    same information as in the plot above, to calculate the percentages first. So copy the first two lines 
    of the previous pipe (that is, the name of the tibble and the count function).
  CorrectAnswer: mock_verbs %>% count(Verb, De_complement, Reflexive_pronoun)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mock_verbs %>% count(Verb, De_complement, Reflexive_pronoun)')
  Hint: Copy your code from above!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    We will add the percentages by creating a new column called `Percentage`. The calculation is easy:
    we want to divide the values in `n` by the sum of `n` and multiply it by 100. That is, we want to 
    write `n/sum(n)*100`. Do it by adding `mutate()` to your pipe.
  CorrectAnswer: mock_verbs %>% count(Verb, De_complement, Reflexive_pronoun) %>% mutate(Percentage = n/sum(n)*100)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mock_verbs %>% count(Verb, De_complement, Reflexive_pronoun) %>% mutate(Percentage = n/sum(n)*100)')
  Hint: Remember that the syntax of mutate requires an equal sign between the name of the new column and its value.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    This is… almost what we wanted to do. We just calculated the global percentages, considering all values.
    However, we want to have the percentages within smaller groups of variables! As you can see in your 
    plot, we want to have them for each combination of verb and presence/absence of De_complement.
    For this we need the function `group_by()`, which we have to add BEFORE our mutate. Group your data
    by Verb and De_complement (in this order).
  CorrectAnswer: mock_verbs %>% count(Verb, De_complement, Reflexive_pronoun) %>% group_by(Verb, De_complement) %>% mutate(Percentage = n/sum(n)*100)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mock_verbs %>% count(Verb, De_complement, Reflexive_pronoun) %>% group_by(Verb, De_complement) %>% mutate(Percentage = n/sum(n)*100)')
  Hint: Don't forget to add the pipes where they are needed!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    This is the table that we want to have. Can you see that every two values in the `Percentage` column
    add up to 100? That's what we needed. We can now create the plot with the same code as above, copying
    and pasting it! We only need to adapt two things. In aes(), `y` should now take the values of 
    `Percentage`, not of `n`. And we don't need the `scales` argument in `facet_wrap`, because we just
    made the scales the same by using percentages. Do it now.
  CorrectAnswer:  >
    mock_verbs %>% count(Verb, De_complement, Reflexive_pronoun) %>% group_by(Verb, De_complement) %>% mutate(Percentage = n/sum(n)*100) %>% ggplot(aes(x = De_complement, y = Percentage, fill = Reflexive_pronoun)) + geom_col() + facet_wrap(~Verb) + scale_fill_manual(values = wes_palette("Darjeeling1")[c(5, 2)])

  Hint: >
    You need to copy your code from above, adding ggplot() after a pipe, until the end of your code (which 
    ended with `scale_fill_manual`), and adapt it as indicated.

    This was a lot of plotting, so I think you deserve a break. Remember that you can save any plot you
    want with ggsave!
