  Lesson: 25. Automatically tagging corpora
  Author: Carlota de Benito Moreno
  Type: Standard
  Organization: University of Zurich
  Version: 2.4.5

- Class: text
  Output: Hi there! Welcome to this last session of the course. We've come a long way, thanks for sharing the ride!
  
- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson we'll use the library `udpipe` to learn how to automatically tag a corpus with the material of the project Universal Dependencies and compare the results of different language models. I have presented this project in class, so go watch the video if you haven't yet! As a Christmas exception, we'll work with English, since that's our only common language and it's kind of important that we understand the text we're working with today.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: > 
    With the library `udpipe` you can directly download some language models. For English, four are available.
    We'll work with all four today, so that we can compare their results. You can download these models with the function
    `udpipe_download_model()`. Run `?udpipe_download_model` to get the help file, so that you see the available models,
    listed under the argument `language`.
  CorrectAnswer: ?udpipe_download_model
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='?udpipe_download_model')
  Hint: Simply run `?udpipe_download_model`.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: > 
    Let's download the model "english-ewt" first. You just need to add that string within `udpipe_download_model()`. 
  CorrectAnswer: udpipe_download_model("english-ewt")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='udpipe_download_model("english-ewt")')
  Hint: Keep the quotation marks in "english-ewt"`.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: > 
    The model has now been downloaded to your working directory. In order to load it to your environment, we can use 
    the function `udpipe_load_model()`. It requires the argument `file`, whose value is the name of the file.
    In this case, that is "english-ewt-ud-2.5-191206.udpipe" (again with quotation marks). Save the whole thing to an 
    object called `en_ewt`.
  CorrectAnswer: en_ewt <- udpipe_load_model(file = "english-ewt-ud-2.5-191206.udpipe")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='en_ewt <- udpipe_load_model(file = "english-ewt-ud-2.5-191206.udpipe")')
  Hint: Within `udpipe_load_model()` you need to have `file = "english-ewt-ud-2.5-191206.udpipe")`. Don't forget to assign it a name with `<-`!
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: > 
    You can use `udpipe_load_model()` next time that you want to load the model, but you won't need to download it again, 
    since it's already in your computer (it'll need to be in your working directory, though). We must repeat this 
    process for the other three English models now. Download the model "english-gum".
  CorrectAnswer: udpipe_download_model("english-gum")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='udpipe_download_model("english-gum")')
  Hint: You need the function `udpipe_download_model()`, adapt you code from above.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: > 
    Now load it and save it as `en_gum`. If you start writing "english" and press the tab key, RStudio should offer you
    some possible file names depending on what you have on your working directory. If that doesn't happen, this is the 
    string you need: "english-gum-ud-2.5-191206.udpipe".
  CorrectAnswer: en_gum <- udpipe_load_model(file = "english-gum-ud-2.5-191206.udpipe")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='en_gum <- udpipe_load_model(file = "english-gum-ud-2.5-191206.udpipe")')
  Hint: You need the function `udpipe_load_model()`, adapt you code from above.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Download now the model "english-lines".
  CorrectAnswer: udpipe_download_model("english-lines")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='udpipe_download_model("english-lines")')
  Hint: You need the function `udpipe_download_model()`, adapt you code from above.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now load it and save it as `en_lines`. The name of the file is "english-lines-ud-2.5-191206.udpipe".
  CorrectAnswer: en_lines <- udpipe_load_model(file = "english-lines-ud-2.5-191206.udpipe")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='en_lines <- udpipe_load_model(file = "english-lines-ud-2.5-191206.udpipe")')
  Hint: You need the function `udpipe_load_model()`, adapt you code from above.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Our last model is "english-partut". Download it now.
  CorrectAnswer: udpipe_download_model("english-partut")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='udpipe_download_model("english-partut")')
  Hint: You need the function `udpipe_download_model()`, adapt you code from above.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now load it and save it as `en_partut`. The name of the file is "english-partut-ud-2.5-191206.udpipe".
  CorrectAnswer: en_partut <- udpipe_load_model(file = "english-partut-ud-2.5-191206.udpipe")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='en_partut <- udpipe_load_model(file = "english-partut-ud-2.5-191206.udpipe")')
  Hint: You need the function `udpipe_load_model()`, adapt you code from above.

- Class: text
  Output: That was a bit tedious… Working with four models requires some repetition!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Instead of annotating a real corpus, we'll try with an easy sentence that I've stored as a vector for you. Print `text` to see it.
  CorrectAnswer: text
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='text')
  Hint: Simply print the name of the object.
  
- Class: text
  Output: As you can see, this is just a (long) sentence stored as a single element in a vector.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Let's annotate this sentence with the function `udpipe_annotate()`. Its first argument is the language model: use
    `en_ewt`. Its second argument is the data it has to annotate: `text`.
  CorrectAnswer: udpipe_annotate(en_ewt, text)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='udpipe_annotate(en_ewt, text)')
  Hint: It has the two arguments I told you about and you don't need quotations whatsoever.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "The result is a quite messy data frame, but nothing that the tidyverse cannot solve: add `as_tibble()` with a pipe to your previous code."
  CorrectAnswer: udpipe_annotate(en_ewt, text) %>% as_tibble()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='udpipe_annotate(en_ewt, text) %>% as_tibble()')
  Hint: Just a good old pipe followed by `as_tibble()`.

- Class: text
  Output: >
    This is what `udpipe_annotate()` did: it tokenized our sentence and created a table with one row per token
    (punctuation marks are also tokens). It assigned a number of ids to each token (since this was a a single document,
    with a single paragraph and a single sentece, those were pretty easy). It also assigned a lemma; a 
    pos-tag of the universal set of the UD project (upos) and a pos-tag of the specific treebank (xpos), and
    a set of morphological features (feats). It has also parsed the sentence syntactically: column `head_token` 
    let's you know which head each token is related to (for instance, tokens 1 to 5 are associated with token 6, 
    the word "sentece"). Column `dep_rel` let's you know what kind of relationship this is. Column `deps` is empty in this case,
    but otherwise it provides information for an "enhanced dependency graph" we won't deal with. Last, column `misc`
    is used to reconstruct the original text and has information about spaces inside a token - note that you only see some
    information there for token 8, which is the first part of a contraction ("I'm").
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: > 
    Although this tibble has much more information than the one we dealt with last week, with the NOAH's corpus data, 
    you already now how to search for patterns and combinations of patterns in this kind of data. We won't focus on
    that today, but let's briefly review what you learnt last week. First, find out all possible values
    in `feats` by using `distinct()`. Add it with a pipe to your code above.
  CorrectAnswer: udpipe_annotate(en_ewt, text) %>% as_tibble() %>% distinct(feats)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='udpipe_annotate(en_ewt, text) %>% as_tibble() %>% distinct(feats)')
  Hint: The single argument of `distinct()` is the column whose unique values you want (`feats`).
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: As you can see, this column stores a lot of information, including a large number of morphological features. Let's find out the unique values in column `upos` now.
  CorrectAnswer: udpipe_annotate(en_ewt, text) %>% as_tibble() %>% distinct(upos)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='udpipe_annotate(en_ewt, text) %>% as_tibble() %>% distinct(upos)')
  Hint: Adapt the code you just wrote.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    We could look for very complex sequences by combining the informaton in these two columns. Let's find out all verbs
    or auxiliaries ("VERB" and "AUX" in column `upos`) preceded by a 1st person personal pronoun (which is described
    in `feats` by the sequence "Person=1|PronType=Prs", but note that this is only a partial match: any row that has this 
    information has some more information too). Copy the code you just had, but replace `distinct()` by `filter()`. 
    Because we have two conditions in our search, we need a complex logical expression, whose 
    two members should be connected by `&`. The first element selects the rows in `upos` that are either "AUX" or "VERB", 
    so you'll need the operator `%in%`. The second element requires a regex, since you're interested in just a part of the string.
    That is, you'll have to use `str_detect()`.
    Because you want to look into the element before the verb/auxiliary, its first argument should
    be `lag(feats)`, to indicate that you're looking in the column `feats` and the row before of the one selected by 
    the first member of the logical expression. The regex is quite similar to the fragment I gave you above, but you'll
    have to escape '|'.
  CorrectAnswer: >
    udpipe_annotate(en_ewt, text) %>% as_tibble() %>% filter(upos %in% c("AUX", "VERB") & str_detect(lag(feats), "Person=1\\|PronType=Prs"))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='udpipe_annotate(en_ewt, text) %>% as_tibble() %>% filter(upos %in% c("AUX", "VERB") & str_detect(lag(feats), "Person=1\\\\|PronType=Prs"))')
  Hint: >
    Hopefully you're only having trouble with the second element, so I'll help you with that. It should read:
    `str_detect(lag(feats), "Person=1\\|PronType=Prs")`.
  
- Class: text
  Output: >
    We got three matches, all of which are preceded by 'I' in `text`. Cool! But you know how to do this already, even
    if the logical expressions can get tricky every now and then. Today we'll focus on comparing our models. We'll do 
    that by visualising their differences and similarities, so we would like to have a table with each model. That's
    what we'll do now.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: > 
    We are only going to compare the results regarding pos-tagging, so let's select columns `token_id`, `upos`, and 
    `token`. Again, start your code as you did above, by using `udpipe_annotate()` to annotate `text` with the `en_ewt`
    model and transform it into a tibble with `as_tibble()`. This time, add `select()` with a pipe after those lines.
  CorrectAnswer: udpipe_annotate(en_ewt, text) %>% as_tibble() %>% select(token_id, upos, token)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='udpipe_annotate(en_ewt, text) %>% as_tibble() %>% select(token_id, upos, token)')
  Hint: Please, follow the order that I used in the instructions for the arguments of select.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We'd like to have information about the model we used in our tibble, so add a column called `model` with the value "ewt".
  CorrectAnswer: udpipe_annotate(en_ewt, text) %>% as_tibble() %>% select(token_id, upos, token) %>% mutate(model = "ewt")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='udpipe_annotate(en_ewt, text) %>% as_tibble() %>% select(token_id, upos, token) %>% mutate(model = "ewt")')
  Hint: Did you remember to use `mutate()`? You'll need quotation marks for "ewt".

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now save the result as `test_ewt`
  CorrectAnswer: test_ewt <- udpipe_annotate(en_ewt, text) %>% as_tibble() %>% select(token_id, upos, token) %>% mutate(model = "ewt")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='test_ewt <- udpipe_annotate(en_ewt, text) %>% as_tibble() %>% select(token_id, upos, token) %>% mutate(model = "ewt")')
  Hint: Simply assign it the name by means of the `<-` operator.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Tediousness again! Adapt your code above to create `test_gum`. You'll need to adapt the name of the model (`en_gum`)
    and the value in column `model`: "gum".
  CorrectAnswer: test_gum <- udpipe_annotate(en_gum, text) %>% as_tibble() %>% select(token_id, upos, token) %>% mutate(model = "gum")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='test_gum <- udpipe_annotate(en_gum, text) %>% as_tibble() %>% select(token_id, upos, token) %>% mutate(model = "gum")')
  Hint: Adapt your code from above.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Now create `test_partut`. You need to adapt the name of the model (`en_partut`) and the value in column `model`: "partut".
  CorrectAnswer: test_partut <- udpipe_annotate(en_partut, text) %>% as_tibble() %>% select(token_id, upos, token) %>% mutate(model = "partut")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='test_partut <- udpipe_annotate(en_partut, text) %>% as_tibble() %>% select(token_id, upos, token) %>% mutate(model = "partut")')
  Hint: Adapt your code from above.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    And, last, create `test_lines`. You need to adapt the name of the model (`en_lines`) and the value in column `model`: "lines".
  CorrectAnswer: test_lines <- udpipe_annotate(en_lines, text) %>% as_tibble() %>% select(token_id, upos, token) %>% mutate(model = "lines")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='test_lines <- udpipe_annotate(en_lines, text) %>% as_tibble() %>% select(token_id, upos, token) %>% mutate(model = "lines")')
  Hint: Adapt your code from above.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    We'll now combine these four tables. You'll need to use `add_row()` three times (by means of pipes). Add them
    in the order we created them: `test_ewt`, `test_gum`, `test_partut`, `test_lines`.
  CorrectAnswer: test_ewt %>% add_row(test_gum) %>% add_row(test_partut) %>% add_row(test_lines)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('test_ewt %>% add_row(test_gum) %>% add_row(test_partut) %>% add_row(test_lines)', 'add_row(test_ewt, test_gum) %>% add_row(test_partut) %>% add_row(test_lines)')
  Hint: The function `add_row()` takes the two tibbles to be joined as arguments.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Because some tokens are appear more than once in our sentence but we'd like to have them separately in our 
    visualization, we'll change the information in column `token` to paste the information in `token_id` with `str_c()`,
    so that our tokens are unique. Use `mutate()` to modify `token` so that we'll get a sequence with the number in 
    `token_id`, followed by "_" and, after that, the word in `token`. Add it to your code above with a pipe.
  CorrectAnswer: test_ewt %>% add_row(test_gum) %>% add_row(test_partut) %>% add_row(test_lines) %>% mutate(token = str_c(token_id, "_", token))
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('test_ewt %>% add_row(test_gum) %>% add_row(test_partut) %>% add_row(test_lines) %>% mutate(token = str_c(token_id, "_", token))', 'add_row(test_ewt, test_gum) %>% add_row(test_partut) %>% add_row(test_lines) %>% mutate(token = str_c(token_id, "_", token))')
  Hint: >
    The function `str_c()` requires three arguments: token_id, "_" and token. You only need quotation marks for the underscore.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Last, we'd like our visualization to be ordered by `token_id`, but because this column is codified as character, 
    it's actually ordered alphabetically (as in 1, 10, 11…). Let's transform it into a numeric vector with `as.numeric()`.
  CorrectAnswer: test_ewt %>% add_row(test_gum) %>% add_row(test_partut) %>% add_row(test_lines) %>% mutate(token = str_c(token_id, "_", token), token_id = as.numeric(token_id))
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('test_ewt %>% add_row(test_gum) %>% add_row(test_partut) %>% add_row(test_lines) %>% mutate(token = str_c(token_id, "_", token), token_id = as.numeric(token_id))', 'add_row(test_ewt, test_gum) %>% add_row(test_partut) %>% add_row(test_lines) %>% mutate(token = str_c(token_id, "_", token), token_id = as.numeric(token_id))', 'test_ewt %>% add_row(test_gum) %>% add_row(test_partut) %>% add_row(test_lines) %>% mutate(token = str_c(token_id, "_", token)) %>% mutate(token_id = as.numeric(token_id))', 'add_row(test_ewt, test_gum) %>% add_row(test_partut) %>% add_row(test_lines) %>% mutate(token = str_c(token_id, "_", token)) %>% mutate(token_id = as.numeric(token_id))')
  Hint: Did you remember to embed it in `mutate()`?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's save the result in an objecto called `comparison`.
  CorrectAnswer: comparison <- test_ewt %>% add_row(test_gum) %>% add_row(test_partut) %>% add_row(test_lines) %>% mutate(token = str_c(token_id, "_", token), token_id = as.numeric(token_id))
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('comparison <- test_ewt %>% add_row(test_gum) %>% add_row(test_partut) %>% add_row(test_lines) %>% mutate(token = str_c(token_id, "_", token), token_id = as.numeric(token_id))', 'comparison <- add_row(test_ewt, test_gum) %>% add_row(test_partut) %>% add_row(test_lines) %>% mutate(token = str_c(token_id, "_", token), token_id = as.numeric(token_id))', 'comparison <- test_ewt %>% add_row(test_gum) %>% add_row(test_partut) %>% add_row(test_lines) %>% mutate(token = str_c(token_id, "_", token)) %>% mutate(token_id = as.numeric(token_id))', 'comparison <- add_row(test_ewt, test_gum) %>% add_row(test_partut) %>% add_row(test_lines) %>% mutate(token = str_c(token_id, "_", token)) %>% mutate(token_id = as.numeric(token_id))')
  Hint: Simply assign it the name with `<-`.

- Class: figure
  Output: >
    One way of visualising the coincidences and discrepancies between these four models would be as in the plot you 
    have now in the plot tab: the (ordered) tokens in the x-axis, the different pos-tags in the y-axis and one line per model.
    Most of the time all lines follow the same path, but, when they don't, it means that not all models annotated
    the token with the same tags.
  Figure: Line_plot.R
  FigureType: new
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Let's create the plot ourselves. First, use a pipe to reorder the column `token` of the tibble `comparison` on
    the bases of the column `token_id` with `reorder()`.
  CorrectAnswer: comparison %>%  mutate(token = reorder(token, token_id))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='comparison %>%  mutate(token = reorder(token, token_id))')
  Hint: Did you remember to use `mutate()`? The first argument of `reorder()` is the column you want to reorder (`token`), while its second argument is the column you want to reorder it by (`token_id`).
 
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Now add `ggplot()` with another pipe. Within its argument `aes()` (remember that it's a function), set the arguments
    `x` to `token` and `y` to `upos`. We'll add three more arguments: `group`, `linetype` and `colour` and set them 
    all to `model`. They indicate that there should be one line per model, with different line types and colours.
  CorrectAnswer: comparison %>%  mutate(token = reorder(token, token_id)) %>% ggplot(aes(x = token, y = upos, group = model, linetype = model, colour = model))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='comparison %>%  mutate(token = reorder(token, token_id)) %>% ggplot(aes(x = token, y = upos, group = model, linetype = model, colour = model))')
  Hint: Remember that all those areguments are arguments of `aes()`, not of `ggplot()`.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    You already knew that the plot would be empty, right? :) The geom_ function we need is `geom_line()`. Add it to your code with `+`.
  CorrectAnswer: comparison %>%  mutate(token = reorder(token, token_id)) %>% ggplot(aes(x = token, y = upos, group = model, linetype = model, colour = model)) + geom_line()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='comparison %>%  mutate(token = reorder(token, token_id)) %>% ggplot(aes(x = token, y = upos, group = model, linetype = model, colour = model)) + geom_line()')
  Hint: Did you use a pipe or a plus sign to add `geom_line()`?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    You can't see much because of how the x-axis is displayed. We've learnt how to rotate the x-axis labels for such
    cases, but we'll use a different mechanism now. Add the function `scale_x_discrete()` with `+` and set its
    argument `guide` to the function `guide_axis()`. Within the latter, add the argument `n.dodge` and set it to 2.
    This will alter the position of each of every two labels so that they don't overlap.
  CorrectAnswer: comparison %>%  mutate(token = reorder(token, token_id)) %>% ggplot(aes(x = token, y = upos, group = model, linetype = model, colour = model)) + geom_line() + scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge = 2))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='comparison %>%  mutate(token = reorder(token, token_id)) %>% ggplot(aes(x = token, y = upos, group = model, linetype = model, colour = model)) + geom_line() + scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge = 2))')
  Hint: The argument `guide` should be equal to `guide_axis(n.dodge = 2)`. Pay attention to what function each argument belongs to!
  
- Class: text
  Output: Remember that you can zoom in your plot to see it better.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Another possible visualization could use barplots. Let's try it out. Again, after reordering column `token`, add 
    `ggplot() with a new pipe. Within its argument `aes()`, set `x` to `upos` and `fill` to `model`, so that each
    model is represented by a different colour. Last, add `geom_bar()` after `+`.
  CorrectAnswer: comparison %>% mutate(token = reorder(token, token_id)) %>% ggplot(aes(x = upos, fill = model)) + geom_bar()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='comparison %>% mutate(token = reorder(token, token_id)) %>% ggplot(aes(x = upos, fill = model)) + geom_bar()')
  Hint: The beginning of you code should look identical to the line plot you just created. Adapt the rest (you don't need `scale_x_discrete()` now!)
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Obviously, this is a complete chaos, because we haven't included `token` as a variable. We'll do it now: add
    `facet_wrap()` after `+` to your code and write `token` as its first argument. Remember that it must be preceded
    by `~`. Add a second argument, `scales`, and set it to "free_x".
  CorrectAnswer: comparison %>% mutate(token = reorder(token, token_id)) %>% ggplot(aes(x = upos, fill = model)) + geom_bar() + facet_wrap(~token, scales = "free_x")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='comparison %>% mutate(token = reorder(token, token_id)) %>% ggplot(aes(x = upos, fill = model)) + geom_bar() + facet_wrap(~token, scales = "free_x")')
  Hint: You need the quotations in "free_x".
  
- Class: text
  Output: Now we have a small bar plot for each token (you'll probably need to zoom in). Whenever there is more than one column, it means that different models reached different conclusions about the pos-tag of the word. For instance, is "test" a noun or and adjective, since it appears before another noun? That's not a simple question, no wonder machines get confused!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    How could we only take into account the cases where there were discrepancies, so that we don't have that many barplots? 
    As always, there are different ways of doing this. Let's try one of them. Start a new piece of code and use a 
    pipe to group `comparison` by `token_id`.
  CorrectAnswer: comparison %>% group_by(token_id)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='comparison %>% group_by(token_id)')
  Hint: The function you're looking for is `group_by()`.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Now we'll create a new column with the number of times that each pos-tag appears within those groups. For that we can use
    the function `add_count()`. This function does not require mutate, you can add it directly with a pipe. Write
    `upos` as its single argument and it will add a column called `n` with the results of counting each pos-tag in `upos`. Because 
    the tibble is grouped, it counts only within each group of token_id. Use another pipe to ungroup the tibble.
  CorrectAnswer: comparison %>% group_by(token_id) %>% add_count(upos) %>% ungroup()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='comparison %>% group_by(token_id) %>% add_count(upos) %>% ungroup()')
  Hint: Add `add_count(upos)` with a pipe and don't forget to add `ungroup()` afterwards.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Whenever `n` has a value of 4 it means that all models predicted the same pos-tag. Filter the tibble to keep
    only cases where `n` is smaller than 4.
  CorrectAnswer: comparison %>% group_by(token_id) %>% add_count(upos) %>% ungroup() %>% filter(n < 4)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='comparison %>% group_by(token_id) %>% add_count(upos) %>% ungroup() %>% filter(n < 4)')
  Hint: The operator that indicates 'smaller than' is `<`.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Save the result to an object called `comparison_short`.
  CorrectAnswer: comparison_short <- comparison %>% group_by(token_id) %>% add_count(upos) %>% ungroup() %>% filter(n < 4)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='comparison_short <- comparison %>% group_by(token_id) %>% add_count(upos) %>% ungroup() %>% filter(n < 4)')
  Hint: Assign it the name with `<-`.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now run again the code you prepared for creating the bar plot, but use `comparison_short` instead of `comparison`.
  CorrectAnswer: comparison_short %>% mutate(token = reorder(token, token_id)) %>% ggplot(aes(x = upos, fill = model)) + geom_bar() + facet_wrap(~token, scales = "free_x")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='comparison_short %>% mutate(token = reorder(token, token_id)) %>% ggplot(aes(x = upos, fill = model)) + geom_bar() + facet_wrap(~token, scales = "free_x")')
  Hint: The only thing you need to adapt from the code you used for the bar plot is the name of the tibble.

- Class: text
  Output: This plot is easier to inspect. Because we had a very small piece of text to work with, it's easy to look at each case individually and decide which model worked better. As you can see, trouble arises in grammatical words, such as "that", "as", "by", that can typicall serve several functions, but also in words that appear in complex syntactic contexts, such as a noun in aposition to another noun ("test sentence") or an adjective arguably used as a noun ("the littlest").

- Class: text
  Output: Lemmatization, pos-tagging, morphological annotation… They are all processes that allow us for conducting more sophisticated analysis. Some corpora are already annotated, and we've learnt now how to annotate them ourselves. (Working with a .txt or .csv file looks exactly the same, you can try it out as voluntary homework, check OLAT.) 
  
- Class: text
  Output: But I think it's crucial that we keep in mind that automatic annotation always makes mistakes. Machines are not perfect and language is extremely complex. So it's always good practice to review the results we get, look for inconsistencies and evaluate how big an effect they can have in our analysis. Machines can help us, but we're still in charge and must be rigurous with our work! That means that we need to invest a bit more time than if we blindly trust the machine, but still much less than if we have to do all the work by hand!
